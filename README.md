# XMLRegexTest
Repository for testing an xml filtering Statement.

## Description
This Repository is for testing to kinds of filtering statements. As per the extension of the VSTS Test Executor with XML Functionality, I have to add two (if not possible only one) stable Regex statement(s) that filter an XML string inside of a XML string seperated by different seperator keywords like 'body:', 'header:' or 'WAIT'.
